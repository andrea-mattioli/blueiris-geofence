# blueiris-geofence
This project was created for the need to use the BlueIris geofence features for free, using some Life360 app APIs (available for both Android and IOS) and BlueIris.
You can configure what kind of operations blueiris-geofence should be performed when Life360 Circle's members are away or inside of their Home.

I would like to mention the sources from which I took some material:
